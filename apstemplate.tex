\begin{abstract}
Pump-probe schemes using high frequency pulsed light synchronous to strong field low frequency fields are a prolific tool for probing atomic, molecular and surface electron dynamics. We realize one such system in Rydberg states of Li using an 819-nm excitation laser amplutde modulated synchronously to a 15.9-GHz microwave field. We show that when the modulation is at the same frequency of the microwave field, phase dependent ionization is only observed in the presence of static fields. Our results are well described by a computational model. Analysis of this model shows the importance of multiple classical electron orbits.

\section{\label{exp}Experimental Methods}

\textbf{\emph{Physical orientation}}
In this experiment, Li atoms in a columated thermal beam are optically excited to high lying Rydberg or continuum states along the path $2s \rightarrow 2p \rightarrow 3d \rightarrow nf, \epsilon f$. These optical beams intersect at a right angle forming a rectangular 1 mm$^3$ excitation region. This region is at an anti-node of a 15.9 GHz Fabry-Perot microwave cavity. The 1-mm$^3$ region is much smaller than the extent of the microwave antinode, allowing us to consider the microwave field constant across the region. The interaction region is enclosed on top, bottom and two sides by aluminum plates. Combined with the two Fabry-Perot mirrors, this forms a 10-cm cubic enclosure. Bias voltages can be applied independently to each plate and mirror to control static fields in the interaction region.

\textbf{\emph{Timing}}
The microwave cavity is allowed to load for 280 ns before the first laser pulse, and the microwave input is shut off 10 ns after the last laser pulse allowing the cavity to empty. Synchronous with the MW power envelope, a static field pulse is applied to the top and bottom aluminum plates to produce a vertical static field in the interaction region. The 610-nm and 671-nm lasers are pulsed synchronously for 20 ns, after which the 819-nm laser is pulsed with a square envelope for 20 ns. One microsecond after the last laser pulse, we field ionize surviving Rydberg states within 100 GHz of the ioniztion limit by applying a negative voltage pulse to an aluminum plate below the interaction region. Ionized electrons are pushed into a microchannel plate (MCP) assembly which produces a voltage pulse proportional to the number of electrons detected. This pulse is integrated through a boxcar integrator and recorded.

% figures should be put into the text as floats.
% Use the graphics or graphicx packages (distributed with LaTeX2e)

% See the LaTeX Graphics Companion by Michel Goosens, Sebastian Rahtz,
% and Frank Mittelbach for instance.

% Here is an example of the general form of a figure:
% Fill in the caption in the braces of the \caption{} command. Put the label
% that you will use with \ref{} command in the braces of the \label{} command.
% Use the figure* environment if the figure should span across the
% entire page. There is no need to do explicit centering.

% Here is an example of the general form of a table:
